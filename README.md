## What is VirtuDrive?

ACS enables remote control of a vehicle without any remote control or other hardware, just a computer and a camera. It examines the movements of people in front of the camera and examines the commands they give in a virtual remote control. They can follow live images of their vehicles from all directions and can drive by constantly seeing data such as road, speed, location, route information and weather conditions.

## How does it work?
It is enough for people to have a computer and a camera. After running the program on their computers, they will see the vehicles on the screen and connect with them. After this connection, an interface will appear in accordance with their vehicles. For cars, one steering wheel, pedals, signal buttons, one joystick and throttle for the drone can be given as examples. Let's give an example for the drone: When the person brings his hand right under the throttle in front of the camera and pushes it upwards, the arm will move upwards. With this movement, the new value will be displayed on the screen and the drone will be powered by this value. In this way, the vehicle will be able to take off by rotating the motors. And again, when he wants to change the flight mode of the vehicle, he will be able to switch to the desired mode from the options. At any time, it can switch to autonomous driving for the vehicle by specifying locations with the map on the simulation. With the joystick movement, the vehicle can move forward-backward-right and left directions. In this way, the person will be able to give the command they want without taking their eyes off the screen.

## What are the Benefits?
Our main goal is to increase the safety of people in their work. To reduce the number of deaths by increasing their safety in traffic and their control over the vehicle. In addition, it will contribute to the advancement of driverless vehicle technology and contribute to industry and infrastructure.
